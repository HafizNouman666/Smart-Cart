# Smart-Cart
The "Smart Cart" project introduces an innovative approach to enhance the in-store shopping 
journey by employing robotics and automation. This automated cart system is designed to 
accompany shoppers, offering them a seamless and convenient experience. The cart's primary 
function involves intelligent tracking of the shopper, allowing handsfree movement while carrying 
selected items. Through the integration of sensors and real-time tracking algorithms, the cart 
follows the shopper's movements, maintaining a safe distance and navigating smoothly. The 
system's current iteration focuses on providing a user-centric shopping experience, with potential 
expansion to include item recognition through onboard cameras in the future. This project 
leverages hardware components, motion tracking technology, and navigation algorithms to 
showcase the feasibility of an automated shopping companion. Future advancements may involve 
the incorporation of machine learning and computer vision techniques to enable accurate item 
detection, further enhancing the efficiency and convenience of the shopping process. The "Smart 
Cart" project exemplifies a promising step towards transforming conventional shopping 
paradigms, paving the way for enhanced customer comfort and retail efficiency.
